### Features Left to Implement

- Introducing another page where users can access real videos and images of the course would be highly advantageous.

## Testing

- I have checked the website on different screen sizes and it works well.
- To increase the performance of the website, I changed the images from .jpg or .png to .webp when the size of the images were too large.
- On the Home page, the position of the images is dependent on which cellphone size is used. I could not fix this issue.
- The webpage works well when I used Google chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge web browsers.

### Validator Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

When I use media query for cellphone size, in the home page, the first green bullet point goes to the right side of the screen in google chrome while in firefox it is in a correct side. I have checked different parameters in my css styling but I could not solve it. I also searched on google and stack overflow and still the isuue was not solved.
